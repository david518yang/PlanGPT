> Allow users to select hotels above a certain star rating
> Include website and google map links for accomodations

# Winner

> The winning idea is an app that covers all 3 of our ideas from step 4. It will be a travel planner that takes a start and end destination, and an amount of days, and plans a trip day by day providing a food, accomodation, and sightseeing stop (if applicable) for each day and new location. Google maps links/business websites will be returned to the user. A user will then have an option to save that itinerary and view their saved itineraries
