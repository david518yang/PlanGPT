# PlanGPT Pitch

### 1. Provide the inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience

> Road trip travelers are a group that need a way to plan out their trips and get the most out of their time.

### 2. Provide the 2â€“3 possible solutions that you picked out from preliminary ideation to express during the exercise
> **Travel Planner:**
Given a start and end destination, generate a list of stops along the way List of places to visit / sightsee at destination Look for filghts/method of transport Take into account user's budgets Allow users to store their generated itineraries

> **Food Place Finder:**
Given locations, find restaurants in the area Look for the best restaurants based on user's needs This might include price range, dietary restrictions, or what food they want Output a list of restaurants with addresses and websites that they could go to on their trip

> **Accomodation Finder:**
Given locations, find accomodations in the area Take into account price range, and what kind of accomodation the user wants Allow users to select hotels above a certain star rating Include website and google map links for accomodations

### 3. State the idea that your team chose during preliminary ideation and how you fleshed it out
> Our app will be a travel planner that takes a start and end destination, and an amount of days, and plans a trip day by day providing a city, food place, and a sightseeing stop (if applicable) for each day and new location. Google maps links/business websites will be returned to the user if appicable. A user will then have an option to save that itinerary and view their saved itineraries in theapp.


### 4. Provide the final version of the human story for your app, after initially drafting it during the exercise and receiving feedback from other teams
> PlanGPT is an itinerary generator app which helps people plan and get the most out of their road trips
