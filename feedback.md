| Version control | Excellent commit frequency and mostly decent commit messaging—but despite what is stated in _about.md_, the code and commit long show something starkly different: nearly all of the work was done by Lucian and David. Martel shows the icon contribution, yes, but nothing else. And despite the note about Kevin’s commits, there is actually nothing visible in the commit log either under his or Garrett’s account. This is starkly inequitable and unfairly lopsided (–50) | -50 |
| Punctuality | First commit 4/19 4:10pm; last commit 5/3 4:42pm |  |
| | **Total** | **198/250** |
